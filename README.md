# web-grep

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sohomdatta1/web-grep?style=for-the-badge)

Code search/browsing website built using NodeJS. Inspired by [codesearch.wmcloud.org](https://codesearch.wmcloud.org) and [github1s.com](https://github1s.com) (to a certain extent).

## Possible Stack

- React (Material-UI)
- ExpressJS with NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Some sort of git client (Simple-git or nodegit)

## Things I want to implement

- A code browser inspired by mordern text editors
- Inverted indexes to aid in searching repositories for specific code
- c-tags to allow for navigation between references and definitions of functions
- Support for definitions/quick lookup of inbuilt/package function definitions

## Test the website

- Install MongoDB
- Clone repository
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```npm run start```
